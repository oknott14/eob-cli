# 🏥 EOB PDF Data Extractor

## Introduction

This project implements an intelligent document processing system that transforms unstructured Explanation of Benefits (EOB) PDFs into structured JSON data. Built for healthcare automation workflows, the application leverages Google's Gemini Flash model with modern AI orchestration frameworks to extract critical claims information with high accuracy and reliability.
EOB documents contain essential healthcare data buried within complex, varied layouts across different insurance providers. This tool bridges the gap between human-readable insurance documents and machine-processable data, enabling downstream automation for claims processing, patient billing, and healthcare analytics.

## Overview

The EOB PDF Data Extractor is a command-line application designed to:

- Process single PDFs or batch ZIP files containing multiple EOB documents
- Extract structured claims data including patient information, provider details, service dates, and financial breakdowns
- Handle layout variations gracefully across different insurance carriers and document formats
- Provide consistent JSON output suitable for integration with healthcare management systems
- Maintain high accuracy through intelligent prompt engineering and structured output validation
